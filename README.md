Pre-review code for "Cognitive Attractors in the Cultural Evolution of Religion".

Victor MÃ¸ller Poulsen and Simon DeDeo

Submitted to *COGSCI*, 1 February 2023.

Relies on preprocessing, and inference from https://github.com/victor-m-p/cultural-landscapes (https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/2/264)

## Components

### ```/data```
* ```data/mdl_experiments```: processed DRH data (post-MPF).
* ```data/clean```: processed DRH data (pre-MPF).
* ```data/reference```: reference files (i.e. ensuring links between questions and cultures). 
* ```data/analysis```: files used for the DRH analysis in ```/DRH```. 

Raw data from the DRH (i.e. pre-curation) is not provided given size limits.
The analysis presented here relies on the curation and inferred parameters of https://github.com/victor-m-p/cultural-landscapes.

### ```/fig```
Figures for "Inferring Cultural Landscapes with the Inverse Ising Model". Currently only the figures for ```5. Results: The Database of Religious History``` (see ```/DRH``` for code). 


### ```/tables```
Tables for "Inferring Cultural Landscapes with the Inverse Ising Model". In particular, tables documenting the DRH dataset used in the article. See ```/DRH``` for code. 

### ```/DRH```
```DRH``` contains the ```Python``` (and ```Julia```) code to reproduce the DRH analysis as presented in "Inferring Cultural Landscapes with the Inverse Ising Model". It contains both the preprocessing, data-curation, creation of tables (for ```/tables```) and creation of figures (for ```/fig```). See ```/DRH``` for more details. 

### ```/MPF_CMU``` 
the ```MPF_CMU``` optimized C code is not included in this workspace. We use the output from https://github.com/victor-m-p/cultural-landscapes (refer there for the inference algorithm).
